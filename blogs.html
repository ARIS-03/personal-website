                <h1>Real Struggle of Student's In Bad Coding Culture </h1>
            <small>August, 2021</small>
            <p>This blog is gonna be my first ever blog I m writing it's about bad coding culture or student who wants to code but doesn't find a good way to how to code . This journey start's like when we enter in a college where we get the stream what we want but we don't get that guidance which we are looking for I know many of you get my point I m talking about Tier-3 colleges where the student's set their dream to get into FAANG. Unfortunately few achieve this dream so my main focus was on the bad coding culture or guidance we are getting from everywhere. Today we can see on youtube the amount of content was coming is unpredictable every new morning we get a different kind of videos on the internet which makes student mind very less focus on a particular thing which he/she was doing before. The people who want to code are giving more importance on information rather than doing coding which is the most important part student are only following the information but not applying in there real life they are not making projects or anything which showcase their work they are following the YouTubers video daily they get in a loop where they watch a new youtube video and get excited does that thing which was told by a YouTuber then the new thing they see they follow that so they are stuck in an infinite loop where students are doing everything only expects to code and then they feel very demotivated and say coding is very hard.</p>
                <p>I don't understand students not getting this point everyone is on the internet is giving advice but the main purpose is not given by everyone which is coding how to do code I'm not saying everyone is providing false information rather than the information we are forgetting that bits of advice doesn't make our career beautiful but coding can make so try to focus on coding rather than the number of pieces of information. I want to conclude that we can only become a good programmer if we try to code and gets our hand dirty by coding every single day. Most importantly try to surround yourself with good people who can teach us people who can motivate us. If you want to become a good coder try into a community where you can resolve your all doubts as I m in <strong>teamTanay sir community</strong>  where you can learn about everything about Full-stack development here you can resolve your doubts you can learn many things also. So do code as much as possible to be in a good coding culture that makes your future bright.</p>

                    <h1>What's the feeling after getting into a Tier-3 college</h1>
                <small>August, 2021</small>
               <p>This blog is gonna interesting because everyone wants to talk about their good experiences but this experience is a little bit different its a mixture of some good & bad experiences which many students go through in there life when they dream to get into top institutes of India (IIT's) but some of them make it possible and some of us don't. The journey starts from 9 class where we were told by our parents that we want to become doctors and engineers and want to take admission to top colleges. But after doing so much hard work we get into Tier-3 colleges but the pain doesn't stop here because now we have to face some kind of discrimination because we didn't perform well in our JEE exam so now it's time to pay off. The feeling we get is that we get a good job after our BTech degree is completed. We can get into big MNC's make our parents proud after they spend lakh's of money on our education or we have to sell fruits and vegetables on roadside. This kind of fear comes when we get into a tier 3 college but I come over this fear when I see that it can do hard work anything is possible.</p>
                   <P> But someone of says if you are that much a hardworking guy then the way you not too into IIT's so I want to say that in India the career starts from the age of 25 after completing higher education and what does thing means its mean at a very young age we totally depend on our parents we think ourselves we are so much hardworking which is not true. Before this, our hard work is shown up by our grades and we are busy in coaching institutes and this thing is not hard work where we are depended on our parents at a very young age its's not fault our parents the surrounding which we are in is like that so we cannot do anything. If our surrounding is not enabling us to do better in life, so it's better to change the surrounding but at that time the surrounding was we get into IIT.Try to think 10 lakh students sit for a particular exam and is guaranteed 1% of students get into IIT's and some other good colleges so what about the 99% who not into these colleges so what does it mean they are useless this kind of discrimination doesn't stop here you see some recruiters what they write only tier-1 fresher or graduates so what about 95% and doesn't mean that all are useless everyone done some hard-work and acquire some skill. I want to conclude that if you are capable to get into IIT or some good colleges it's well and good to go for it but don't think if u not get into a top college everything is over but at the end of the day your hard work will get you a better life.</P>
